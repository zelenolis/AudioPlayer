<p>Hello!<br>  
This is my personal audio player pet project.</p>

<p>This project offers a curated selection of free music, but you can add your own MP3 files to tailor your playlist.
Thanks to the robust ['JS MediaTags'](https://github.com/aadsm/jsmediatags) integration, the audio tags and album covers shine with precision and vibrancy.</p>

Join me for exciting new projects!
